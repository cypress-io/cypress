# Driver

This is the core JavaScript library that is loaded inside the browser that is responsible for executing Cypress commands and managing the test runtime.

## Building

The driver is actually consumed by the [`runner`](../runner) like any other npm module. To develop the driver and see changes reflected you need to run the `watch` task inside of the runner.

```bash
yarn workspace @packages/runner watch
```

## Developing

If you're developing on the driver, you'll want to run in the normal Cypress GUI mode, like you would when you're writing tests for your own Cypress projects.

```bash
yarn workspace @packages/driver cypress:open
```

Read the runner's [`README.md`](../runner/README.md) for more information.

## Running

You can also run all of the driver's tests locally. We don't really recommend this because it takes a long time, and we have this process optimized by load balancing the tests across multiple workers in CI.

It's usually easier to run the tests in the GUI, commit, and then see if anything broke elsewhere.

```bash
# in separate terminal
yarn workspace @packages/driver cypress:run

# or for development
yarn workspace @packages/driver cypress:open
```

## Debug Logs

The `debug` module is used to generate debug logs for the driver. In the browser, you can enable driver debug logs by setting `localStorage.debug` in the console:

```js
localStorage.debug = "cypress:driver,cypress:driver:*"
```

Note: you may need to enable "Verbose" or "Debug" log levels inside the browser's developer tools, since not all browsers display debug logs by default.

## Patches

- `sinon`
- `unfetch` to polyfill `fetch`. Added constructor function to point XMLHttpRequest to the application under test window.

Note: when creating a patch, make sure there is no `package-lock.json` file! Also rename the patch to have ".dev.patch" extension.

## Example 1.

Given this test:

```js
describe('parent', () => {
  it('child', () => {
    cy.visit('/index.html')
  })
})
```

The Driver would emit the following events:
