## Cypress Studio Tests

These are the tests for the Cypress Studio feature. [Learn more here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio).

Due to an (currently unknown) reason, if more than 1 test is written per spec file, the second test will fail. For this reason, each file has one test.
