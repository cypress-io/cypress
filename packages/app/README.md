## App

This is the front-end for the Cypress App.

## Development

1. `yarn dev` (inside of `packages/app`)
2. It will open launchpad
3. Select Component Testing (current E2E is not fully working)
3. Open chrome (or another browser)
4. This launches the existing CT Runner. Change the URL to http://localhost:3000/__vite__/ (note the trailing `/`)
5. It should show the new Vite powered app 

## Using existing, Vite-incompatible modules

Some of our modules, like `@packages/reporter`, `@packages/driver` and `@packages/runner-shared` cannot be easily
used with Vite due to circular dependencies and modules that do not have compatible ESM builds.

To work around this, when consuming existing code, it is bundled with webpack and made available under the
`window.UnifiedRunner` namespace. It is injected via [`injectBundle`](./src/runner/injectBundle.ts).

To add more code to the bundle, add it in the bundle root, `@packages/runner-ct/src/main.tsx` and attach it to
`window.UnifiedRunner`.

As a rule of thumb, avoid importing from the older, webpack based modules into this package. Instead, if you want to consume code from those older, webpack bundled modules, you should add them to the webpack root and consume them via `window.UnifiedRunner`. Ideally, update [`index.d.ts`](./index.d.ts) to add the types, as well.

### Icons

The icons will temporarily live in this package and will soon be moved to `packages/frontend-shared`.

## Cy's New Icon Library
Cy has a very custom icon library.
* Most of our icons are duo-tone
* They must be styled in both dark and light contexts (e.g. on a dark menu bar vs on a light background).
* Since they're duotone, you want to target the specific strokes and fills of the SVGs to color them.
* All of the niceties of our utility classes should work (e.g. `group-hover` or `group-focus`).

### Usage
#### Importing Icons
1. `import MyIcon from '~icons/cy/path-to-icon_x16'`
2. Automatic template discovery
```jsx
/* This just works. No imports necessary */
<i-cy-path-to-icon_x16 />
```

#### Styling Icons
```jsx
/* This renders a book icon from `./src/assets/book_x16.svg`
 * and makes it pink and purple
 */

<i-cy-book_x16 class="
  hover:icon-dark-pink-500
  hover:icon-light-purple-300
  icon-dark-pink-300
  icon-dark-purple-50
" />
```

### Implementation: Custom classes w/ a WindiCSS plugin
To support selecting specific paths while keeping tailwind's incredibly helpful interaction helpers (e.g. `group-hover` or `group-focus`), I made a WindiCSS plugin.

I also moved the Windi config into a `.windicss` directory at the root of the App directory.

#### Rules of Icons
For an icon to work well in the current system, here's what needs to happen when we import it:

1. Icon paths must define themselves as "icon-dark" or "icon-light" in their class names.
If an icon path doesn't define a class, nothing bad will happen, it just won't get targeted by any styling.

2. Icons with both a stroke and a fill aren't working correctly right now. They will soon.
You can see this in the video with the Settings cog. It uses and `evenodd` fill pattern and has a path that contains both a stroke and a fill.

3. Finally, you don't need to expose anything. `./src/assets/icons` is automatically watched and loaded ðŸ˜®
