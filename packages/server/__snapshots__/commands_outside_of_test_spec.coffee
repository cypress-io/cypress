  0 passing
  1 failing

  1)  An uncaught error was detected outside of a test:
     Uncaught CypressError: Cannot call "cy.viewport()" outside a running test.

This usually happens when you accidentally write commands outside an it(...) test.

If that is the case, just move these commands inside an it(...) test.

Check your test file for errors.

This error originated from your test code, not from Cypress.

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your test code it will automatically fail the current test.

Cypress could not associate this error to any specific test.

We dynamically generated a new test to display this failure.
