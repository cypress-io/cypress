Oops...we found an error preparing this test file:

  /foo/bar/.projects/e2e/cypress/integration/browserify_babel_es2015_failing_spec.js

The error was:

SyntaxError: /foo/bar/.projects/e2e/lib/fail.js: Unexpected token, expected { (1:7)
> 1 | export defalt "foo"
    |        ^


This occurred while Cypress was compiling and bundling your test code. This is usually caused by:

- A missing file or dependency
- A syntax error in the file or one of its dependencies

Fix the error in your code and re-run your tests.
