  2) includes stack trace in error

  0 passing
  2 failing

  1)  throws when task returns undefined:
     CypressError: cy.task('returns:undefined') failed with the following error:

The task 'returns:undefined' returned undefined. You must return a promise, a value, or null to indicate that the task was handled.

The task handler was:

returns:undefined() {}
