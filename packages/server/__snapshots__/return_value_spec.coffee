  1) errors when invoking commands and return a different value
  2) errors when invoking commands in custom command and returning differnet value

  0 passing
  2 failing

  1)  errors when invoking commands and return a different value:
     CypressError: Cypress detected that you invoked one or more cy commands but returned a different value.

The return value was:

  > {}, 1, 2, foo, function(){}

Because cy commands are asynchronous and are queued to be run later, it doesn't make sense to return anything else.

For convenience, you can also simply omit any return value or return 'undefined' and Cypress will not error.

In previous versions of Cypress we automatically detected this and forced the cy commands to be returned. To make things less magical and clearer, we are now throwing an error.

  2)  errors when invoking commands in custom command and returning differnet value:
     CypressError: Cypress detected that you invoked one or more cy commands in a custom command but returned a different value.

The custom command was:

  > cy.foo()

The return value was:

  > bar
