Oops...we found an error preparing this test file:

  /foo/bar/.projects/e2e/cypress/integration/record_error_spec.coffee

The error was:

Error: Cannot find module '../it/does/not/exist' from '/foo/bar/.projects/e2e/cypress/integration'


This occurred while Cypress was compiling and bundling your test code. This is usually caused by:

- A missing file or dependency
- A syntax error in the file or one of its dependencies

Fix the error in your code and re-run your tests.

  1)  An uncaught error was detected outside of a test:
     Uncaught Error: instantly fails

This error originated from your test code, not from Cypress.

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your test code it will automatically fail the current test.

Cypress could not associate this error to any specific test.

We dynamically generated a new test to display this failure.
