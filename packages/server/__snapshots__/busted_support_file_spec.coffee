  (Tests Starting)
Oops...we found an error preparing this test file:

  /foo/bar/.projects/busted-support-file/cypress/support/index.js

The error was:

Error: Cannot find module './does/not/exist' from '/foo/bar/.projects/busted-support-file/cypress/support'


This occurred while Cypress was compiling and bundling your test code. This is usually caused by:

- A missing file or dependency
- A syntax error in the file or one of its dependencies

Fix the error in your code and re-run your tests.
