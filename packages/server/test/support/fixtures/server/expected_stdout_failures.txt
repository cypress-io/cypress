  1) stdout_failing_spec fails:
     Error: foo
      at Context.<anonymous> (http://localhost:2020/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/integration/stdout_failing_spec.coffee-456:6:13)

  2) stdout_failing_spec failing hook "before each" hook for "is failing":
     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

/does-not-exist.html

We failed looking for this file at the path:

/foo/bar/.projects/e2e/does-not-exist.html

The internal Cypress web server responded with:

  > 404: Not Found



Because this error occured during a 'before each' hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: 'failing hook'
