// Pro's Top Level
- consistent
- easy to use
- can only publish what i want public
- easy to debug in dev tools (traversing)
- enables me to refactor internal organization w/o breaking API's

// Con's Top Level
- no organization
- long method names
- mish-mash of concerns
- overlapping method names
