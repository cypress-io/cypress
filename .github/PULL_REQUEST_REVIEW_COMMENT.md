Thanks for the contribution! Below are some guidelines Cypress uses when doing PR reviews.

- Please create a [Draft Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) if your PR is not ready for review. [Mark the PR as **Ready for Review**](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#marking-a-pull-request-as-ready-for-review) when you're ready for a Cypress team member to review the PR.
- Please familiarize yourself with the PR Review Checklist and feel free to make updates on your PR based on these guidelines.

## PR Review Checklist

If any of the following requirements can't be met, leave a comment in the review selecting 'Request changes', otherwise 'Approve'.

### User Experience

- The feature/bugfix is self-documenting from within the product.
- The change provides the end user with a way to fix their problem (no dead ends).
- If a breaking change or a change to a commonly used API, the proposed changes have been discussed and agreed upon in the weekly team meeting (or a separate meeting if a larger change).

### Functionality

- The code works and performs its intended function with the correct logic.
- Performance has been factored in (for example, the code cleans up after itself to not cause memory leaks).
- The code guards against edge cases and invalid input and has tests to cover it.

### Maintainability

- The code is readable (too many nested 'if's are a bad sign).
- Names used for variables, methods, etc, clearly describe their function.
- The code is easy to understood and there are relevant comments explaining.
- New algorithms are documented in the code with link(s) to external docs (flowcharts, w3c, chrome, firefox).
- There are comments containing link(s) to the addressed issue (in tests and code).

### Quality

- The change does not reimplement code.
- There's not a module from the ecosystem that should be used instead.
- There is no redundant or duplicate code.
- There are no irrelevant comments left in the code.
- Tests are testing the codeâ€™s intended functionality in the best way possible.

### Internal

- The original issue has been tagged with a release in ZenHub.
