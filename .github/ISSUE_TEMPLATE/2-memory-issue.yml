        Have a question? ðŸ‘‰ [Ask in chat](https://on.cypress.io/discord) or [start a new discussion](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions).

        Prior to logging a memory issue, please make sure you are running the latest version of Cypress and have enabled [`experimentalMemoryManagement`](https://on.cypress.io/experiments) for Chromium-based browsers (introduced in Cypress 12.4.0). 

        If you are running in `cypress open` mode, you can also try lowering [`numTestsKeptInMemory`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Options) in your config file.

        If you are still experiencing the issue, please fill out the following information.
