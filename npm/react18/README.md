# @cypress/react18

Mount React 18 components in the open source [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner

> **Note:** This package is bundled with the `cypress` package and should not need to be installed separately. See the [React Component Testing Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/react/overview) for mounting React components. Installing and importing `mount` from `@cypress/react18` should only be done for advanced use-cases.
