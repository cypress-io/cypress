# @cypress/webpack-dev-server

> **Note** this package is not meant to be used outside of cypress component testing.

Install `@cypress/vue` or `@cypress/react` to get this package working properly

To install `@cypress/webpack-dev-server` in you component testing environment,
1. Install it `yarn add @cypress/webpack-dev-server`
2. Add it to `cypress/plugins/index.js`

```js

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('dev-server:start', async (options) => startDevServer({ options }))

  return config
}
```

## Architecture

### Cypress server

- Every HTTP request goes to the cypress server which returns an html page. We call "TOP" because of its name in the dev tools
    This page
    - renders the list of spec files
    - And the timetraveling command log
    - Finally, it renders an AUT Iframe. this iframe calls a url that has 2 parts concatenated.
        - a prefix: `__cypress/iframes/` 
        - the path to the current. For example: `src/components/button.spec.tsx`
- In the cypress server, calls prefixed with `__cypress/iframes/...` will be passed to the dev-server as `__cypress/src/index.html`
- Every call with the prefix `__cypress/src/` will be passed to the dev-server to deal as is, without changes.

### Dev-server

- Responds to every query with the prefix `__cypress/src/` (base path should be this prefix).
- Responds to `__cypress/src/index.html` with an html page. 
    This page
    - will contain an element `<div id="__cy_root"></div>` to attach the mounted components to.
    - will load support files
    - will load the current spec from the url
    - will start the test when both files are done loading
- The server re-runs the tests as soon as the current spec or any dependency is updated
by calling an event `devServerEvents.emit('dev-server:compile:success')`

## Webpack

Webpack-dev-server fulfills his reponsibilities by

- Making a `webpack.config` from the users setup by changing the entrypoint to `browser.ts`
- Launches the webpack dev server with `devServer.publicPath = "__cypress/src/"` and `devServer.hot = false`
- The entry point (`browser.ts`) delegates the loading of spec files to the loader. 
    - By using a require on itself, it enables using a custom loader and Hot Module Replacements if hot is false.
- The plugin is responsible for passing down the path to the support files and the list of specs discovered by the cypress server to the loader
- The loader:
    - compares the url with each spec path given by the plugin
    - picks the spec that should be run
    - runs the `AUT-Runner.ts` to load and launch the support file and the current spec

## API

`startDevServer` takes an object of options.

- `options` (required): this contains various internal configuration. It's provided as the first argument to the `dev-server:start` event. Just make sure you pass it to the `startDevServer`.
- `webpackConfig` (optional): the webpack config used by your application. We provide some [presets](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/react/plugins), but you can pass the `webpackConfig` manually, too.
- `template` (optional): by default [this index.html](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/npm/webpack-dev-server/index-template.html) is used. You can provide your own using this option. This is useful if you'd like to include some CDN links, or in some way customize the default html. If you are passing this option, ensure your `index.html` contains the same content as [the default template](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/npm/webpack-dev-server/index-template.html). Some of our presets include a custom `index.html`, such as [Next](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/react/plugins/next). 

See [npm/react/plugins/next](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/npm/react/plugins/next/index.js) for a full example using all the options.

## Performance tests 

In order to get webpack performance statistics run `yarn cypress open-ct` or `yarn cypress run-ct` with `WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE` env variable:

```sh
WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE=true yarn cypress run-ct
```

This will output the timings of whole webpack output and timings for each specified plugin and loader. 

### Compare results

In order to run performance tests and compare timings with the previous build run:

```sh
WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE=true WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE_COMPARE={name-of-project} yarn cypress run-ct
```

This will create the file `./__perf-stats/{name-of-project}.json` or if this file exists will compare results with the previously saved version. 

In order to update the `{name-of-project}.json` file and use new stats as a base for the next comparisons run:  

```sh
WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE=true WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE_UPDATE=true WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE_COMPARE={name-of-project} yarn cypress run-ct
```
