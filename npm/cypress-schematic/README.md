 Add this schematic to quickly get up and running with [Cypress](https://cypress.io) in your Angular project.

 ___

 ## What does this schematic do?

**Once added to your project, it will:**

‚úÖ  Install Cypress

‚úÖ  Add npm scripts for running Cypress in `run` mode and `open` mode

‚úÖ  Scaffold base Cypress files and directories

‚úÖ  Optional: prompt you to add or update the default `ng e2e` command to use Cypress.

## Usage ‚èØ

Install the schematic:

```shell
ng add @cypress/schematic
```
To run Cypress in `open` mode within your project: 

```shell script
ng run {project-name}:cypress-open
```

To run Cypress headlessly via `run` mode within your project:

```shell script
ng run {project-name}:cypress-run
```

If you have chosen to add or update the `ng e2e` command, you can also run Cypress in `open` mode using this:

```shell script
ng e2e
```

## Builder Options üõ†

### Running the builder with a specific browser

Before running Cypress in `open` mode, ensure that you have started your application server using `ng serve`.

```json
"cypress-open": {
  "builder": "@cypress/schematic:cypress",
  "options": {
    "watch": true,
    "headless": false,
    "browser": "chrome"
  },
  "configurations": {
    "production": {
      "devServerTarget": "{project-name}:serve:production"
    }
  }
}
```

Read our docs to learn more about [launching browsers](https://on.cypress.io/launching-browsers) with Cypress.

### Recording test results to the Cypress Dashboard

We recommend setting your [Cypress Dashboard](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/introduction) recording key as an environment variable and NOT as a builder option when running it in CI.

```json
"cypress-run": {
  "builder": "@cypress/schematic:cypress",
  "options": {
    "devServerTarget": "{project-name}:serve",
    "record": true,
    "key": "your-cypress-dashboard-recording-key"
  },
  "configurations": {
    "production": {
      "devServerTarget": "{project-name}:production"
    }
  }
}
```

Read our docs to learn more about [recording test results](https://on.cypress.io/recording-project-runs) to the [Cypress Dashboard](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/introduction).

### Specifying a custom `cypress.json` config file

It may be useful to have different Cypress configuration files per environment (ie. development, staging, production).

```json
"cypress-run": {
  "builder": "@cypress/schematic:cypress",
  "options": {
    "devServerTarget": "{project-name}:serve",
    "configFile": "cypress.production.json"
  },
  "configurations": {
    "production": {
      "devServerTarget": "{project-name}:production"
    }
  }
}
```

Read our docs to learn more about all the [configuration options](https://on.cypress.io/configuration) Cypress offers.

### Running Cypress in parallel mode within CI

```json
"cypress-run": {
  "builder": "@cypress/schematic:cypress",
  "options": {
    "devServerTarget": "{project-name}:serve",
    "parallel": true,
    "record": true,
    "key": "your-cypress-dashboard-recording-key"
  },
  "configurations": {
    "production": {
      "devServerTarget": "{project-name}:production"
    }
  }
}
```
