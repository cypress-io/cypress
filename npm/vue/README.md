# @cypress/vue

Mount Vue 3 components in the open source [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner

> **Note:** This package is bundled with the `cypress` package and should not need to be installed separately. See the [Vue Component Testing Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/vue/overview) for mounting Vue components. Installing and importing `mount` from `@cypress/vue` should only be done for advanced use-cases.
## Development

Run `yarn build` to compile and sync packages to the `cypress` cli package.

Run `yarn cy:open` to open Cypress component testing against real-world examples.
