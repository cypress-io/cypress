> A little helper to unit test React components in the open source [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner **v7.0.0+**

**Jump to:** [Comparison](#comparison), [Blog posts](#blog-posts), [Install](#install), Examples: [basic](#basic-examples), [advanced](#advanced-examples), [full](#full-examples), [external](#external-examples), [Style options](#options), [Code coverage](#code-coverage), [Visual testing](#visual-testing), [Common problems](#common-problems), [Chat](#chat)

## TLDR

- What is this? This package allows you to use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner to unit test your React components with zero effort. Here is a typical component testing, notice there is not external URL shown, since it is mounting the component directly.

![Example component test](images/dynamic.gif)

- How is this different from [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) or [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)? It is similar in functionality BUT runs the component in the real browser with full power of Cypress E2E test runner: [live GUI, full API, screen recording, CI support, cross-platform](https://www.cypress.io/features/), and [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing). 
- If you like using `@testing-library/react`, you can use `@testing-library/cypress` for the same `findBy`, `queryBy` commands, see one of the examples in the list below

## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12 or above.

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/react @cypress/webpack-dev-server
```

## Init

You can use our command line wizard to give you instructions on configuring this plugin. It will try to determine which framework or bundling tool you are using and give you instructions on right configuration.

```sh
npx create-cypress-tests --component-tests
```

Or continue with manual installation in the plugin file

1. Tell Cypress how your React application is transpiled or bundled (using Webpack), so Cypress can load your components. For example, if you use `react-scripts` (even after ejecting) do:

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require('@cypress/react/plugins/react-scripts')(on, config)
  // IMPORTANT to return the config object
  // with the any changed environment variables
  return config
}
```

See [Recipes](./docs/recipes.md) for more examples.

2. You can specify a glob to locate component spec files. For example, to have them located in `src` folder use:

```json
{
  "component": {
    "specPattern": "src/**/*.cy.jsx"
  }
}
```

## API

- `mount` is the most important function, allows to mount a given React component as a mini web application and interact with it using Cypress commands
- `createMount` factory function that creates new `mount` function with default options
- `unmount` removes previously mounted component, mostly useful to test how the component cleans up after itself
- `mountHook` mounts a given React Hook in a test component for full testing, see `hooks` example

## Examples

```js
import React from 'react'
import { mount } from '@cypress/react'
import { HelloWorld } from './hello-world.jsx'
describe('HelloWorld component', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    mount(<HelloWorld />)
    // now use standard Cypress commands
    cy.contains('Hello World!').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

To find more examples, see GitHub topic [@cypress/react-example](https://github.com/topics/@cypress/react-example)

## Options

In most cases, the component already imports its own styles, thus it looks "right" during the test. If you need another CSS, the simplest way is to import it from the spec file:

```js
// src/Footer.spec.js
import './styles/main.css'
import Footer from './Footer'
it('looks right', () => {
  // styles are applied
  mount(<Footer />)
})
```

### Extra styles

You can pass additional styles, css files and external stylesheets to load, see [docs/styles.md](./docs/styles.md) for the full list of options.

```js
const todo = {
  id: '123',
  title: 'Write more tests',
}
mount(<Todo todo={todo} />, {
  stylesheets: [
    'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.2/css/bulma.css',
  ],
})
```

<details>
<summary>Additional configuration</summary>
If your React and React DOM libraries are installed in non-standard paths (think monorepo scenario), you can tell this plugin where to find them. In `cypress.json` specify paths like this:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "@cypress/react": {
      "react": "node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js",
      "react-dom": "node_modules/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

You may also specify the `ReactDOM` package to use. This can be useful in complex monorepo setups that have different versions of React and React DOM installed. If you see an error relating to [mismatching versions of React or React DOM](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#mismatching-versions-of-react-and-react-dom), this may be the solution. You can do this using the `ReactDom` option:

```jsx
// if you have multiple versions of ReactDom in your monorepo
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'

mount(<Todo todo={todo} />, {
  stylesheets: [
    'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.2/css/bulma.css',
  ],
  ReactDom
})
```

## Code coverage

In order to use code coverage you can follow the instructions from [docs](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage). In most of cases you need to install 2 dependencies: 

```
npm i @cypress/code-coverage babel-plugin-istanbul

yarn add @cypress/code-coverage babel-plugin-istanbul
```

If you are using [plugins/cra-v3](plugins/cra-v3) it instruments the code on the fly using `babel-plugin-istanbul` and generates report using dependency [cypress-io/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) (included). If you want to disable code coverage instrumentation and reporting, use `--env coverage=false` or `CYPRESS_coverage=false` or set in your `cypress.json` file

```json
{
  "env": {
    "coverage": false
  }
}
```

## Visual testing

You can use any Cypress [Visual Testing plugin](https://on.cypress.io/plugins#visual-testing) to perform [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing) from the component tests. This repo has several example projects, see [visual-sudoku](examples/visual-sudoku), [visual-testing-with-percy](examples/visual-testing-with-percy), [visual-testing-with-happo](examples/visual-testing-with-happo), and [visual-testing-with-applitools](examples/visual-testing-with-applitools).

For a larger Do-It-Yourself example with an hour long list of explanation videos, see [bahmutov/sudoku](https://github.com/bahmutov/sudoku) repository. I explain how to write visual testing using open source tools in this [blog post](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/open-source-visual-testing-of-components/), [video talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00BNExlJUU8), and [slides](https://slides.com/bahmutov/i-see-what-is-going-on).

## Common problems

<details id="fast-enough">
  <summary>Slower than Jest</summary>

When you use `cypress-X-unit-test` for component testing, you might notice the tests are slower than using Jest to test the same components. Yes, that's true. A test runner could be made _extremely_ fast if it did nothing, just check out the [auchenberg/volkswagen](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen) test runner - it is blazing on CI üòâ. Of course, Jest does do things, just not inside the real browser environment.

Testing using Jest with its jsdom browser is faster than starting the real browser, loading all libraries, mounting the component and then waiting for the component to actually perform its work in response to the test's actions. But do those tests give you a true confidence that the component is working?

Try this test üôà

Spoiler: it fails, [proof](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-testing-library-demo-forked-z7l2o?file=/src/__tests__/components.js).

```js
const mock = jest.fn()
// render a component that does NOT allow any click events
// using pointerEvents: "none" style
const { getByRole } = render(
  <button style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }} onClick={mock}>
    text
  </button>,
)
// Jest happily clicks
fireEvent.click(getByRole('button'))
expect(mock).not.toBeCalled()
```

Cypress test on the other hand [fails correctly](cypress/component/basic/fails-correctly).

We think that using `cypress-X-unit-test` runs tests as _fast as your application code is_, and often you need to think how to _slow down_ the Cypress Test Runner so it does not run away from the component's code, just see our blog posts dealing with [test flake](https://cypress.io/blog/tag/flake/).

From the developer's perspective I would ask myself: which tests do I _write faster_? What happens when a test fails and I need to debug the failure: which test runner allows me to _debug a failed test quicker_? While I am partial, I have to say, realistic Cypress tests are easier to write and debug.

Finally, when running tests on the continuous integration service, the true test speed up comes from properly configuring [dependencies caching](https://on.cypress.io/caching) and running [tests in parallel](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) - something we have extensively documented and consider a solved problem.

## Development

See [docs/development.md](./docs/development.md)

## Debugging

You can see verbose logs from this plugin by running with environment variable

```
DEBUG=@cypress/react
```

Because finding and modifying Webpack settings while running this plugin is done by [find-webpack](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-webpack) module, you might want to enable its debug messages too.

```
DEBUG=@cypress/react,find-webpack
```
