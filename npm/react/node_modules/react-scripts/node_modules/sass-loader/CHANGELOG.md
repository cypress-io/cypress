### [8.0.1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v8.0.0...v8.0.1) (2020-01-10)


### Bug Fixes

* support webpack@5 ([#794](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/794)) ([6c59e37](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/6c59e37e3f67668d7a3908444ddfc0176bc5601f))

## [8.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.3.1...v8.0.0) (2019-08-29)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* minimum required `webpack` version is `4.36.0`
* minimum required `node.js` version is `8.9.0`
* move all sass (`includePaths`, `importer`, `functions`, `outputStyle`) options to the `sassOptions` option. The `functions` option can't be used as `Function`, you should use `sassOption` as `Function` to achieve this.
* the `data` option was renamed to the `prependData` option
* default value of the `sourceMap` option depends on the `devtool` value (`eval`/`false` values don't enable source map generation)


### Features

* automatically use the `fibers` package if it is possible ([#744](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/744)) ([96184e1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/96184e1))
* source map generation depends on the `devtool` option ([#743](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/743)) ([fcea88e](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/fcea88e))
* validate loader options ([#737](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/737)) ([7b543fc](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/7b543fc))
* reworked error handling from `node-sass`/`sass`
* improve resolution for `@import` (including support `_index` and `index` files in a directory)

### Bug Fixes

* compatibility with `pnp`

## [7.0.3](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.0.2...v7.0.3) (2018-06-05)


### Bug Fixes

* Bare imports not working sometimes (#579) ([c348281](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/c348281)), closes [#566](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/566)

## [7.0.2](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.0.1...v7.0.2) (2018-06-02)


### Bug Fixes

## [7.0.1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1) (2018-04-13)


### Bug Fixes

* Wrong import precedence (#557) ([f4eeff1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/f4eeff1))



<a name="7.0.0"></a>
# [7.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v6.0.7...v7.0.0) (2018-04-13)


### Features

* Refactor resolving and simplify webpack config aliases (#479) ([e0fde1a](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/e0fde1a))
* Remove `node-sass` from `peerDependencies` (#533) ([6439cef](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/6439cef))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Drop official node 4 support
* This slightly changes the resolving algorithm. Should not break in normal usage, but might break in complex configurations.
* The sass-loader throws an error at runtime now and refuses to compile if the peer dependency is wrong. This could break applications where npm's peer dependency warning was just ignored.

### Bug Fixes

* Add temporary fix for stuck processes (see [sass/node-sass#857](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/857)) [#100](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/100) [#119](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/119) [#132](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/132)

### Code Refactoring

* Refactor [import resolving algorithm](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/089c52dc9bd02ec67fb5c65c2c226f43710f231c/index.js#L293-L348). ([#138](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/138)) ([c8621a1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/80944ccf09cd9716a100160c068d255c5d742338))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The new algorithm is aligned to libsass' way of resolving files. This yields to different results if two files with the same path and filename but with different extensions are present. Though this change should be no problem for most users, we must flag it as breaking change.
