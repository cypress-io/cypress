## Package manager

This wizard will automatically determine which package do you use. If `yarn` available as global dependency it will use yarn to install dependencies and create lock file. 

If you need to use `npm` over `yarn` you can do the following

```
npx create-cypress-tests --use-npm
```

By the way you can use yarn to run the installation wizard ðŸ˜‰

```
yarn create cypress-tests
```

```
npm init
npm install typescript
npx create-cypress-tests 
```
