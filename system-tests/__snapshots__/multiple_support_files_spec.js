exports['e2e multiple support files passes 1'] = `
There are multiple support files.

Your supportFile is set to /foo/bar/.projects/multiple-support-files/cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}, and we found /foo/bar/.projects/multiple-support-files/cypress/support/e2e.js, /foo/bar/.projects/multiple-support-files/cypress/support/e2e.ts

Correct your supportFile config or merge the files into one.
