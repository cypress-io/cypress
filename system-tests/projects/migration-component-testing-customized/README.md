# Migration Component Testing Customized

A component tesing project without e2e. We ask the users to migrate their specs manually.

The following migration steps will be used during this migration:

Steps:

- [ ] automatic file rename
- [x] manual file rename
- [ ] rename support
- [x] update config file
- [x] setup component testing

## Automatic Migration

Not used.

## Manual Files

The user will need to rename and/or move their only component specs, `button.spec.js` and `input-spec.tsx`, to their new location. As long as these files are removed, this step is considered complete. We do not verify where it went, or what the new name and and extension are.

## Rename supportFile

Not used. `supportFile: false` is set. We woudl normally put this in your `e2e.supportFile` key. We assume a top level `supportFile` is used for E2E testing. Since this project does not have E2E configured, we just skip this step.

## Update Config

The expected output is in [`expected-cypress.config.js`](./expected-cypress.config.js).

## Setup Component Testing

Users are required to reconfigure component testing, since the API is changing so much (we now use a `devServer` key in the config to start their dev server, etc).
