## Migration E2E Component With JSON files

A project with E2E and CT, both using default folders. Everything is default. It 
includes JSON files in the integration and component folders, migrating those, 
without changing the file extension.

The following migration steps will be used during this migration:

- [x] automatic folder rename of cypress/integration to cypress/e2e
- [x] manual file rename
- [x] rename support
- [x] update config file
- [x] setup component testing

## Automatic Migration

Unless the user skips this step, after this step, the filesystem will be:

| Before | After|
|---|---|
| `integration/foo.spec.ts` | `e2e/foo.cy.ts` |
| `integration/spec.ts` | `e2e/spec.cy.ts` |
| `component/button.spec.js` | `component/button.cy.js` |

## Manual Files

The user will need to rename and/or move their only component spec, `button.cy.js` to its new location.

## Rename supportFile

The project has a default support file, `cypress/support/index.js`. We can rename it for them to `cypress/support/e2e.js`. There is no such `cypress/support/component.js` created here - that's going to part of the component testing reconfiguration workflow.

| Before | After|
|---|---|
| `cypress/support/index.js` | `cypress/support/e2e.js` |

## Update Config

We can migrate to the new `cypress.config.js`. The expected output is in `expected-cypress.config.js`. The main points are:

The expected output is in [`expected-cypress.config.js`](./expected-cypress.config.js).
