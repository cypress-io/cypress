A template to use as a starting point when building a Component Framework Definition.

An completed example for [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) is [available here](https://github.com/lmiller1990/cypress-ct-solid-js).

See [the documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/third-party-definitions#List-of-Framework-Definitions) to Learn how to author a Framework Definition for your favorite library!

Once you've written your definition:

- `npm run build` to build it
- update `name` in `package.json`
- publish!
