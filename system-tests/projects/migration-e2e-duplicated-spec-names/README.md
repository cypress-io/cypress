## Migration E2E Defaults

An e2e project with different types of spec names, that can create a collision while renaming. 
We rename the `integrationFolder` and spec extension.

The following migration steps will be used during this migration:

- [x] automatic file rename
- [ ] manual file rename
- [ ] rename support
- [x] update config file
- [ ] setup component testing
