## Migration Custom Config File Migration Already Ocurred

This is the "kitchen sink" of migrations. It has E2E and a custom config file which 
has been already migrated, so when running with the json file it shows the correct
file to be used

The following migration steps will be used during this migration:

- [x] automatic folder rename of cypress/integration to cypress/e2e
- [ ] manual file rename
- [x] rename support
- [x] update config file
- [] setup component testing
