## Migration Custom Config File Respect Pathname

This is the "kitchen sink" of migrations. It has E2E and a custom config file which the pathname
includes extra values - the migration should respect the pathname when creating the new config file

The following migration steps will be used during this migration:

- [x] automatic folder rename of cypress/integration to cypress/e2e
- [ ] manual file rename
- [x] rename support
- [x] update config file
- [] setup component testing
