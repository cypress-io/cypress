/**
 * The snapshot doctor performs a series of steps in order to arrive at
 * metadata which distinguishes between non-problematic aka _healthy_ and
 * problematic aka _deferred_ and _norewrite_ modules.
 *
 * This metada is used when generating the final snapshot script to initialize
 * the snapshot.
 *
 * ## Snapshot Doctor Metadata
 *
 * - `norewrite`: modules that should not be rewritten when generating the
 *    snapshot script as
 * - `deferred`: modules that need to be deferred, that is they can not be
 *    initialized during snapshot initialization
 * - `healthy`: modules that can be fully initialized during snapshot
 *   initialization
 * - `deferredHashFile`: the file use to derive at the current project state
 *    hash, usually the local `yarn.lock`
 * - `deferredHash`: the hash of the `deferredHashFile` at the time that this
 *   metadata was generated
 *
 * The `hash` related properties tell the snapshot doctor for future runs if
 * the metadata can be used as is since the project state didn't change, i.e.
 * no dependencies were changed nor added or removed.
 *
 * If the `deferredHash` does not match the current state then the doctor
 * will start fresh, however if you pass one ore more of the following as part
 * of the {@link SnapshotDoctorOpts | snapshot opts} it will take those as a
 * starting point and complete much faster.
 *
 * ```ts
 * previousDeferred: Set<string>
 * previousHealthy: Set<string>
 * previousNoRewrite: Set<string>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Snapshot Doctor Steps
 *
 * When {@link SnapshotDoctor.heal} is invoked the doctor will keep adapting
 * the bundle that is generated by the bundle until it can be used to
 * initialize the snapshot without running into any issues.
 *
 * It does so by refining the health state and communicating it to the bundler
 * via a config which in turn produces a slightly different bundle each time,
 * designed to avoid those issues.
