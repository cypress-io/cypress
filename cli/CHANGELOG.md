## 12.4.0

_Released 1/24/2023_

**Features:**

- Added official support for Vite 4 in component testing. Addresses
  [#24969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24969).
- Added new
  [`experimentalMemoryManagement`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  configuration option to improve memory management in Chromium-based browsers.
  Enable this option with `experimentalMemoryManagement=true` if you have
  experienced "Out of Memory" issues. Addresses
  [#23391](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23391).
- Added new
  [`experimentalSkipDomainInjection`](/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-Skip-Domain-Injection)
  configuration option to disable Cypress from setting `document.domain` on
  injection, allowing users to test Salesforce domains. If you believe you are
  having `document.domain` issues, please see the
  [`experimentalSkipDomainInjection`](/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-Skip-Domain-Injection)
  guide. This config option is end-to-end only. Addresses
  [#2367](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2367),
  [#23958](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23958),
  [#24290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24290), and
  [#24418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24418).
- The [`.as`](/api/commands/as) command now accepts an options argument,
  allowing an alias to be stored as type "query" or "static" value. This is
  stored as "query" by default. Addresses
  [#25173](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25173).
- The `cy.log()` command will now display a line break where the `\n` character
  is used. Addresses
  [#24964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24964).
- [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component) now
  utilizes a JSX/TSX file extension when generating a new empty spec file if
  project contains at least one file with those extensions. This applies only to
  component testing and is skipped if
  [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component) has been
  configured to exclude files with those extensions. Addresses
  [#24495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24495).
- Added support for the `data-qa` selector in the
  [Selector Playground](guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Selector-Playground) in
  addition to `data-cy`, `data-test` and `data-testid`. Addresses
  [#25305](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25305).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where component tests could incorrectly treat new major
  versions of certain dependencies as supported. Fixes
  [#25379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25379).
- Fixed an issue where new lines or spaces on new lines in the Command Log were
  not maintained. Fixes
  [#23679](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23679) and
  [#24964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24964).
- Fixed an issue where Angular component testing projects would fail to
  initialize if an unsupported browserslist entry was specified in the project
  configuration. Fixes
  [#25312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25312).

**Misc**

- Video output link in `cypress run` mode has been added to it's own line to
  make the video output link more easily clickable in the terminal. Addresses
  [#23913](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23913).
