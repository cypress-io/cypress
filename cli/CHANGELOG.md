## 12.4.0

__Released 01/17/2023 (PENDING)__

**Features:**

- Introduced a new new experimental flag, called [`experimentalSkipDomainInjection`](/guides/references/experiments#experimental-skip-domain-injection), to disable Cypress from setting `document.domain` on injection of any pages that url hostname matches the array of string or glob pattern provided. When there is a match, all subdomain navigation and cross-origin navigation that matches this configuration, will require the use of [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) interact with the page. This option was added resolve known issues observed in testing Google and Salesforce applications. Addresses [#2367](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2367), [#23958](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23958), [#24290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24290) and [#24418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24418).
- Utilize a JSX/TSX file extension when generating a new empty spec file if project contains at least one file with those extensions. This applies only to component testing and is skipped if [`component.specPattern`](/api/commands/session) has been configured to exclude files with those extensions. Addresses [#24495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24495).
