## 13.0.0

_Released 03/1/2023 (PENDING)_

**Breaking Changes:**

- The [`cy.readFile()`](/api/commands/readfile) command is now retry-able as a [query command](https://on.cypress.io/retry-ability). This should not affect any tests using it; the functionality is unchanged. However, it can no longer be overwritten using [`Cypress.Commands.overwrite()`](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands). Addressed in [#25595](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25595).

## 12.15.0

_Released 06/20/2023 (PENDING)_

**Features:**

- Added support for running Cypress tests with [Chrome's new `--headless=new` flag](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/). Chrome versions 112 and above will now be run in the `headless` mode that matches the `headed` browser implementation. Addresses [#25972](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25972).
- The [`videoCompression`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Videos) configuration option now accepts both a boolean or a Constant Rate Factor (CRF) number between `1` and `51`. The `videoCompression` default value is still `32` CRF and when `videoCompression` is set to `true` the default of `32` CRF will be used. Addresses [#26658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26658).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where video output was not being logged to the console when `videoCompression` was turned off. Videos will now log to the terminal regardless of the compression value. Addresses [#25945](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25945).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Removed [`@cypress/mocha-teamcity-reporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/mocha-teamcity-reporter) as this package was no longer being referenced. Addressed in [#26938](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/26938).

## 12.14.0

_Released 06/07/2023_

**Features:**

- A new testing type switcher has been added to the Spec Explorer to make it easier to move between E2E and Component Testing.

  - This can be used to override Cypress's default behavior of logging all XHRs and fetches, see the [example](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept#Disabling-logs-for-a-request).
- It is now possible to control the number of connection attempts to the browser using the `CYPRESS_CONNECT_RETRY_THRESHOLD` Environment Variable. Learn more [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Environment-variables). Addressed in [#25848](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25848).

**Bugfixes:**

## 12.6.0

_Released 02/15/2023_

**Features:**

- Added a new CLI flag, called [`--auto-cancel-after-failures`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#Options), that overrides the project-level ["Auto Cancellation"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation) value when recording to the Cloud. This gives Cloud users on Business and Enterprise plans the flexibility to alter the auto-cancellation value per run. Addressed in [#25237](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25237).
- It is now possible to overwrite query commands using [`Cypress.Commands.overwriteQuery`](https://on.cypress.io/api/custom-queries). Addressed in [#25078](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25078).
- Added [`Cypress.require()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/require) for including dependencies within the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) callback. This change removed support for using `require()` and `import()` directly within the callback because we found that it impacted performance not only for spec files using them within the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) callback, but even for spec files that did not use them. Addresses [#24976](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24976).
- Added the ability to open the failing test in the IDE from the Debug page before needing to re-run the test. Addressed in [#24850](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24850).

**Bugfixes:**

- When a Cloud user is apart of multiple Cloud organizations, the [Connect to Cloud setup](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/projects#Set-up-a-project-to-record) now shows the correct organizational prompts when connecting a new project. Fixes [#25520](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25520).
- Fixed an issue where Cypress would fail to load any specs if the project `specPattern` included a resource that could not be accessed due to filesystem permissions. Fixes [#24109](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24109).
- Fixed an issue where the Debug page would display a different number of specs for in-progress runs than the in-progress specs reported in Cypress Cloud. Fixes [#25647](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25647).
- Fixed an issue in middleware where error-handling code could itself generate an error and fail to report the original issue. Fixes [#22825](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22825).
- Fixed an regression introduced in Cypress [12.3.0](#12-3-0) where custom browsers that relied on process environment variables were not found on macOS arm64 architectures. Fixed in [#25753](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25753).

**Misc:**

- Improved the UI of the Debug page. Addresses [#25664](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25664),  [#25669](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25669), [#25665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25665), [#25666](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25666), and [#25667](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25667).
- Updated the Debug page sidebar badge to to show 0 to 99+ failing tests, increased from showing 0 to 9+ failing tests, to provide better test failure insights. Addresses [#25662](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25662).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgrade [`debug`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to `4.3.4`. Addressed in [#25699](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25699).

## 12.4.0

_Released 1/24/2023_

**Features:**

- Added official support for Vite 4 in component testing. Addresses
  [#24969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24969).
- Added new
  [`experimentalMemoryManagement`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  configuration option to improve memory management in Chromium-based browsers.
  Enable this option with `experimentalMemoryManagement=true` if you have
  experienced "Out of Memory" issues. Addresses
  [#23391](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23391).
- Added new
  [`experimentalSkipDomainInjection`](/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-Skip-Domain-Injection)
  configuration option to disable Cypress from setting `document.domain` on
  injection, allowing users to test Salesforce domains. If you believe you are
  having `document.domain` issues, please see the
  [`experimentalSkipDomainInjection`](/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-Skip-Domain-Injection)
  guide. This config option is end-to-end only. Addresses
  [#2367](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2367),
  [#23958](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23958),
  [#24290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24290), and
  [#24418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24418).
- The [`.as`](/api/commands/as) command now accepts an options argument,
  allowing an alias to be stored as type "query" or "static" value. This is
  stored as "query" by default. Addresses
  [#25173](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25173).
- The `cy.log()` command will now display a line break where the `\n` character
  is used. Addresses
  [#24964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24964).
- [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component) now
  utilizes a JSX/TSX file extension when generating a new empty spec file if
  project contains at least one file with those extensions. This applies only to
  component testing and is skipped if
  [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component) has been
  configured to exclude files with those extensions. Addresses
  [#24495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24495).
- Added support for the `data-qa` selector in the
  [Selector Playground](guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Selector-Playground) in
  addition to `data-cy`, `data-test` and `data-testid`. Addresses
  [#25305](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25305).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where component tests could incorrectly treat new major
  versions of certain dependencies as supported. Fixes
  [#25379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25379).
- Fixed an issue where new lines or spaces on new lines in the Command Log were
  not maintained. Fixes
  [#23679](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23679) and
  [#24964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24964).
- Fixed an issue where Angular component testing projects would fail to
  initialize if an unsupported browserslist entry was specified in the project
  configuration. Fixes
  [#25312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25312).

**Misc**

- Video output link in `cypress run` mode has been added to it's own line to
  make the video output link more easily clickable in the terminal. Addresses
