## 12.6.0

_Released 02/14/2023 (PENDING)_

**Features:**

- It is now possible to overwrite query commands using [`Cypress.Commands.overwriteQuery`](https://on.cypress.io/api/custom-queries). Addressed in [#25674](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25674).
- Added the "Open in IDE" feature for failed tests reported from the Debug page. Addressed in [#25691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25691).
- Added a new CLI flag, called [`--auto-cancel-after-failures`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#Options), that overrides the project-level CI ["Auto Cancellation"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation) value when recording to the Cloud. This gives Cloud users on Business and Enterprise plans the flexibility to alter the auto-cancellation value per run. Addressed in [#25237](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25237).
- Added `Cypress.require()` for including dependencies within the `cy.origin()` callback.  Removed support for `require()` and `import()` within the callback. Addresses [#24976](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24976).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue with the Cloud project selection modal not showing the correct prompts. Fixes [#25520](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25520).
- Fixed an issue in middleware where error-handling code could itself generate an error and fail to report the original issue. Fixes [#22825](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22825).
- Fixed an issue that could cause the Debug page to display a different number of specs for in-progress runs than shown in Cypress Cloud. Fixes [#25647](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25647).
- Fixed an issue introduced in Cypress 12.3.0 where custom browsers that relied on process environment variables were not found on macOS arm64 architectures. Fixed in [#25753](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25753).
- Fixed an issue where Cypress would fail to load any specs if the project `specPattern` included a resource that could not be accessed due to filesystem permissions. Fixes [#24109](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24109).

## 12.4.0

_Released 1/24/2023_

**Features:**

- Added official support for Vite 4 in component testing. Addresses
  [#24969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24969).
- Added new
  [`experimentalMemoryManagement`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  configuration option to improve memory management in Chromium-based browsers.
  Enable this option with `experimentalMemoryManagement=true` if you have
  experienced "Out of Memory" issues. Addresses
  [#23391](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23391).
- Added new
  [`experimentalSkipDomainInjection`](/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-Skip-Domain-Injection)
  configuration option to disable Cypress from setting `document.domain` on
  injection, allowing users to test Salesforce domains. If you believe you are
  having `document.domain` issues, please see the
  [`experimentalSkipDomainInjection`](/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-Skip-Domain-Injection)
  guide. This config option is end-to-end only. Addresses
  [#2367](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2367),
  [#23958](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23958),
  [#24290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24290), and
  [#24418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24418).
- The [`.as`](/api/commands/as) command now accepts an options argument,
  allowing an alias to be stored as type "query" or "static" value. This is
  stored as "query" by default. Addresses
  [#25173](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25173).
- The `cy.log()` command will now display a line break where the `\n` character
  is used. Addresses

- [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component) now
  utilizes a JSX/TSX file extension when generating a new empty spec file if
  project contains at least one file with those extensions. This applies only to
  component testing and is skipped if
  [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component) has been
  configured to exclude files with those extensions. Addresses
  [#24495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24495).
- Added support for the `data-qa` selector in the
  [Selector Playground](guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Selector-Playground) in
  addition to `data-cy`, `data-test` and `data-testid`. Addresses
  [#25305](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25305).

  versions of certain dependencies as supported. Fixes

  not maintained. Fixes
  [#23679](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23679) and
  [#24964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24964).
- Fixed an issue where Angular component testing projects would fail to
  initialize if an unsupported browserslist entry was specified in the project
  configuration. Fixes
  [#25312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25312).

**Misc**

- Video output link in `cypress run` mode has been added to it's own line to
  make the video output link more easily clickable in the terminal. Addresses
