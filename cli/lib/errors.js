    Reasons it may be missing:

    - You're caching 'node_modules' but are not caching this path: ${util.getCacheDir()}
    - You ran 'npm install' at an earlier build step but did not persist: ${util.getCacheDir()}

    Properly caching the binary will fix this error and avoid downloading and unzipping Cypress.

    Alternatively, you can run 'cypress install' to download the binary again.
