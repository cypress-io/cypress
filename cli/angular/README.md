> A little helper to unit test React components in the open source [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner **v7.0.0+**

## TLDR

- What is this? This package allows you to use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner to unit test your Angular components with zero effort. Here is a typical component testing, notice there is not external URL shown, since it is mounting the component directly.

- How is this different from [Angular Testing](https://angular.io/guide/testing) or [ATL](https://testing-library.com/docs/angular-testing-library/intro/)? It is similar in functionality BUT runs the component in the real browser with full power of Cypress E2E test runner: [live GUI, full API, screen recording, CI support, cross-platform](https://www.cypress.io/features/), and [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing).

## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12 or above.

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/angular @cypress/webpack-dev-server
```


## API

- `mount` allows you to mount a given Angular component as a mini web application and interact with it using Cypress commands

## Examples

```ts
import { mount } from '@cypress/angular'
import { HelloWorldComponent } from './hello-world.component'

describe('HelloWorldComponent', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    mount(HelloWorldComponent)
    // now use standard Cypress commands
    cy.contains('Hello World!').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

Look at the examples in [cypress/component](cypress/component) folder. Here is the list of examples showing various testing scenarios.

## Options


## Code coverage

In order to use code coverage you can follow the instructions from [docs](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage). In most of cases you need to install 2 dependencies: 

```
npm i @cypress/code-coverage babel-plugin-istanbul

yarn add @cypress/code-coverage babel-plugin-istanbul
```

If you are using [plugins/cra-v3](plugins/cra-v3) it instruments the code on the fly using `babel-plugin-istanbul` and generates report using dependency [cypress-io/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) (included). If you want to disable code coverage instrumentation and reporting, use `--env coverage=false` or `CYPRESS_coverage=false` or set in your `cypress.json` file

```json
{
  "env": {
    "coverage": false
  }
}
```

## Visual testing

You can use any Cypress [Visual Testing plugin](https://on.cypress.io/plugins#visual-testing) to perform [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing) from the component tests. This repo has several example projects, see [visual-sudoku](examples/visual-sudoku), [visual-testing-with-percy](examples/visual-testing-with-percy), [visual-testing-with-happo](examples/visual-testing-with-happo), and [visual-testing-with-applitools](examples/visual-testing-with-applitools).

For a larger Do-It-Yourself example with an hour long list of explanation videos, see [bahmutov/sudoku](https://github.com/bahmutov/sudoku) repository. I explain how to write visual testing using open source tools in this [blog post](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/open-source-visual-testing-of-components/), [video talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00BNExlJUU8), and [slides](https://slides.com/bahmutov/i-see-what-is-going-on).

## Development

See [docs/development.md](./docs/development.md)

## Debugging

You can see verbose logs from this plugin by running with environment variable

```
DEBUG=@cypress/angular
```

Because finding and modifying Webpack settings while running this plugin is done by [find-webpack](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-webpack) module, you might want to enable its debug messages too.

```
DEBUG=@cypress/angular,find-webpack
```
