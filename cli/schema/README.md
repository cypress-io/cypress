# cypress.json file schema

This [schema file](cypress.schema.json) provides definitions for 
[various Cypress configuration](https://on.cypress.io/configuration) properties 
inside `cypress.json` file.
When editing `cypress.json` the schema file is used by 
[Schemastore](http://schemastore.org/json/) to provide IntelliSense and
validation. Works in modern text editors like VSCode, WebStorm and Atom with help with the
help of [autocomplete-json plugin](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-json).
