Error: The cypress npm package is installed, but the Cypress binary is missing.

We expected the binary to be installed here: /cache/Cypress/1.2.3/Cypress.app/Contents/MacOS/Cypress

Reasons it may be missing:

- You're caching 'node_modules' but are not caching this path: /cache/Cypress
- You ran 'npm install' at an earlier build step but did not persist: /cache/Cypress

Properly caching the binary will fix this error and avoid downloading and unzipping Cypress.

Alternatively, you can run 'cypress install' to download the binary again.
